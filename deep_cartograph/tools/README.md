# Tools

This folder contains the tools available in the Deep Cartograph project.

## Overview

Each tool can be used to perform a specific task. The tools are designed to be modular and can be used independently from command line or in combination with other tools through the provided python APIs.

## List of Tools

- **analyze_geometry**: perform some simple geometry analysis like RMSD or RMSF.
- **compute_features**: compute features from a trajectory.
- **filter_features**: filter features based on bi-modality, standard deviation or entropy of their distribution.
- **train_colvars**: compute and train different collective variables from data.
- **traj_projection**: project trajectories onto collective variable space.
- **traj_cluster**: cluster trajectories based on collective variable space.
