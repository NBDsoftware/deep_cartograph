# Tools

This folder contains the tools available in the Deep Cartograph project.

## Overview

Each tool represents a specific application or utility that can be used to perform a specific task or analysis. The tools are designed to be modular and can be used independently or in combination with other tools. Tools can be used from CLI or through the provided APIs.

## List of Tools

- **compute_features**: Contains functions to compute features from molecular dynamics trajectories using PLUMED.
- **filter_features**: Contains functions to filter features based on bi-modality, standard deviation or entropy.
- **train_colvars**: Contains functions to compute and train different collective variables from data.
